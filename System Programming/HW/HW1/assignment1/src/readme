(Answer) I did not receive any help from others while doing this assignment.

(Optional Qusetion1 Answer) I spent approximately 10 hours on this assignment. 
(Optional Question2 Answer) 
It helped me to learn the basic concept of decommenting and tokenizing.
I think it would be better if the assignment was more detailed and had more examples about how to make the files like decomment.i & etc.
Though it was suggested on the ppt, I think it would be better if the assignment had more detailed instructions about how to make the files.

(Optional Quesetion3 Answer) Any information that will help us to grade your work in the most favorable light. 
In particular you should describe all known bugs.
Actually I had 2 bugs for the given test codes. It was when we get the EOF as ch, we need to add the enter at the last(which is '\n') to the output.
And the other one was when we get the ***/ as an input of ch, to check the end of Comment I used 

if(ch=='*'){  
    ich = getchar();
    if(ich=='/'){
      DFAstate=START;
    }
}

then when there was odd number of * infront of /, the error happened. 
SO I add the state to check if the Comment ends.
then It finally worked well.
