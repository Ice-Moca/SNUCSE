(Answer) I did not receive any help from others while doing this assignment.

(Optional Qusetion1 Answer) I spent approximately 4 hours on this assignment. 
(Optional Question2 Answer) Your assessment of the assignment: Did it help you to learn? 
What did it help you to learn? Do you have any suggestions for improvement? Etc.
It helped me to learn the basic concept of decommenting and tokenizing.
I think it would be better if the assignment was more detailed and had more examples about how to make the files like decomment.i & etc.
Though it was suggested on the ppt, I think it would be better if the assignment had more detailed instructions about how to make the files.

(Optional Quesetion3 Answer) Any information that will help us to grade your work in the most favorable light. 
In particular you should describe all known bugs.
Actually I had only 1 bugs for the given test codes. It was when we get the EOF as ch, we need to add the enter(which is '\n') to the output.
