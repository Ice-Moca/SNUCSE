# **09. Dynamic Memory Allocation II Lecture Summary**

## 1. **Metadata Storage and K&R Heap Manager**
- Challenge 
  - The allocator needs to track, for each free block, its starting address, its size (in units), and a pointer to the next free block-but it cannot call malloc() or free() to allocate metadata structures since it is itself implementing these functions.
- Solution
  - Embed the metadata directly within each free block-store a header at the block's start (and later a footer at its end) so that the heap manager's data structures grow and shrink dynamically with the heap itself.

## **2. Implicit Free List (Strawman's Approach)**
- Header only: size + alloc-bit, no pointers
- Scan every block-allocated & free
- O(total-blocks) per malloc()/free(), severe overhead

## **3. Explicit Free List: Basic K&R Implementation**
- Header fields: block size, pointer to next free block
- Circular linked list, sorted by address
- Facilitates coalescing of adjacent free blocks

## **4. Malloc: First-Fit and Next-Fit Algorithms**
### 4.1 First-Fit Algorithm
- Start at list head (or roving pointer)
- Traverse until block size &ge; request
- Exact-fit: unlink and return
- Oversized: split into allocated + smaller free block

### 4.2 Next-Fit Algorithm
- "Roving" start pointer at last allocation
- Reduces repeated scans of small blocks
- Average-case speedup, worst-case still linear

## **5. Block Splitting and Link Maintenance**
- Carve requested portion at block front
- Leftover block stays in free list, size adjusted
- Enforce minimum block size to avoid tiny fragments

## **6. Free Operation: Insertion and Coalescing**
### 6.1 Insertion
- Compute header address: user-ptr minus header size
- Traverse free list to find insertion point by address
- Handle wrap-around: freed block before head or after tail

### 6.2 Coalescing
- Upper neighbor: if end of freed block abuts next free block, merge sizes, bypass next node
- Lower neighbor: if start of freed block abuts previous free block, merge sizes, bypass freed node
- Both merges reduce fragmentation

## **7. Strengths of the K&R Approach**
- Simplicity
  - A minimal codebase with clear pointer manipulations, ideal for educational implementations and easy to port in K&R C.
- Basic Optimizations
  - Splitting large blocks avoids internal fragmentation; the roving-pointer next-fit reduces repeated scans of small blocks.
- Fragmentation Mitigation
  - Explicit coalescing of adjacent free blocks reduces external fragmentation over time.

## **8. Weaknesses of the K&R Approach**
- Time Complexity
  - Both malloc() and free() run in O(number of free blocks), which can be large in heap-intensive programs.
- External Fragmentation
  - First-fit tends to leave many small holes; splitting can exacerbate fragmentation if small remainders accumulate.
- Poor Locality
  - Free blocks are scattered, leading to cache misses and potential paging overhead in large heaps.

## **9. Optimizing Free with Doubly-Linked Lists and Footers**
- Header: size + next pointer; footer: size + prev pointer
- Footer at block end duplicates size, points to previous free block
- Doubly-linked list enables backward & forward traversal in O(1)

## **10. Efficient Coalescing via Headers and Footers**
- Next-block lookup: header + size &rarr; next header
- Prev-block lookup: header &rarr; footer &rarr; previous header
- Constant-time neighbor detection, no list scan

## **11. Faster Free Algorithm**
- Inspect adjacent allocation bits via header/footer
- Coalesce with upper & lower in at most two merges
- Insert merged block at front of free list

## **12. Malloc Still a Bottleneck: Segregated Free Lists (Binning)**
- Even with O(1) free(), malloc() still scans free list
- Need to limit search scope &rarr; segregated free lists (binning)

## **13. Binning Strategies (Segregated Free Lists)**
- Array of bins: pointers to size-class free lists
- Exact-Fit bins: one bin per size up to threshold, direct lookup
- Range bins: bins cover size ranges (e.g., 1-2, 3-4 units)
- Final "large" bin for sizes > threshold, splitting as needed

### **13.1 Implementation Details of Segregated Lists**
- Bin-Based Allocation
  - Map request size &rarr; bin index via table or bit operations
  - If target bin empty, search next non-empty bin, split block down
  - Minimal search overhead, approximates best-fit
- Bin-Based Free
  - Determine size class of freed block
  - Coalesce first (via header/footer), then insert into correct bin
  - Block may change bin if size class changes after merge

## **14. Memory Alignment and Padding Considerations**
- Blocks aligned to machine-word boundaries (8/16 bytes)
- Header/footer sizes rounded for alignment
- Minimum block size includes metadata + padding

## **15. Design Trade-Offs in Allocator Implementation**
- Space vs. Time
  - Explicit lists and bins increase metadata overhead but reduce allocation/free time; implicit lists minimize overhead but incur high search costs.
- Fragmentation vs. Throughput
  - First-fit is fast but fragment-prone; best-fit reduces fragmentation but is slower; segregated lists approximate best-fit in constant time.

## **16. Concurrent Allocator Considerations**
- Global free lists &rarr; lock contention
- Per-thread/CPU arenas, thread-local caches
- Fine-grained locks per bin or lock-free structures
- Padding metadata to avoid false sharing

## **17. Advanced Topics for Further Study**
- Buddy allocator
  - Power-of-two splits, trivial coalesce, internal fragmentation
- Slab allocator
  - Fixed-size object caches, high locality, low fragmentation
- Garbage collection
  - Stop-the-world, incremental, concurrent strategies
- NUMA-aware allocation
  - Allocate on local node to reduce cross-node latency

## **18. Assignment 3 Suggestions**
- Incremental approach: headers/footers &rarr; doubly-linked pointers &rarr; binning
- Use assert() liberally: header/footer match, pointer validity, heap-bounds checks
- Visualize heap state: diagrams of blocks, pointers, free lists

## **19. Memory-Related Perils in C**
- Bad pointers: missing & in scanf, invalid deref
- Uninitialized reads: assuming zeroed malloc() memory
- Buffer overflows: gets() into fixed-size buffer, pointer-arithmetic mistakes
- Dangling pointers/double-free: freeing twice, using freed memory
- Memory leaks: forgetting to free, partial frees in linked structures

## **20. Debugging Tools and Techniques**
- gdb: inspect headers/footers, step through allocator code
- mtrace/muntrace: trace malloc/free mismatches, leaks
- valgrind: detect invalid accesses, uninitialized reads, leaks

## **21. Summary of Approaches**
- Implicit lists: simplest, O(n) ops, high fragmentation
- Explicit lists: O(#free) ops, moderate complexity, coalescing support
- Headers/footers: O(1) free, still O(#free) malloc
- Segregated lists: O(1)/O(log (n)) ops, best trade-off for throughput & fragmentation
