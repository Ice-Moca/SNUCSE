# **06.Variables and Memory - Recap Lecture Summary**

## **1. Memory Abstraction**
- Process memory layout: `.text`, `.data`, `.bss`, heap, stack.
- Functions like `main()`, `foo()` reside in `.text` section.
- Global/static variables → `.data` or `.bss` (fixed addresses).
- Local variables → Stack (grows downward; address changes per run).
- ASLR randomizes memory addresses for security.
- Shared memory (e.g., `shared_int`) remains at fixed address across processes.

## **3. Memory Segmentation by Allocation Type**
- Global/static variables → `.data`, `.bss`, `.rodata`.
- Local variables → Stack.
- Dynamic memory → Heap.
- Function parameters → Passed via stack/registers.

## **4. Pointers and Explicit Memory Access**
- Pointers hold memory addresses.
- Enable dynamic allocation and flexible data structures.
- Example:
  ```c
  int a = 5;
  int *ap = &a;
  int **app = &ap;
  ```
- Used for indirection and managing arrays, linked structures.

## **5. Dynamic Memory Allocation**
- malloc() allocates memory from heap.
- Type casting ensures pointer correctness:
- Example:
  ``` c
  int *A = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int) * 1024);
  ```

## **6. Arrays and Pointers in C**
- Static arrays: 
    - Declared with size known at compile time.
    - Address of arr and &arr[0] are equivalent.

- Dynamic arrays: 
    - Allocated at runtime, handled via pointers.
    - Must be deallocated using free().
    char *p = malloc(512 * sizeof(char));
    p is a pointer to the data of p[512]ㄴ
    p[0] refers to the first element of array p
    &p[0] denotes the address of the first element of p and is identical to p

- Array decay: 
    - Passing an array to a function decays it into a pointer to its first element.

- Size confusion:
    - sizeof(buf) vs sizeof(*buf) — the former gives total array size only for static arrays.
    - For dynamic arrays, size must be explicitly tracked.
Examples:
```c
    char buf[512];

    … = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf)); // 전체 배열의 크기 512을 리턴

    char *buf = (char*)malloc(512*sizeof(char));

    … = read(fd, buf, 512*sizeof(char)); //NOT sizeof(buf)! 이때는 포인터의 크기를 준다. 따라서 사용하면 안됨.

    #define BUFSIZE 512
    char *buf = (char*)malloc(BUFSIZE*sizeof(char));

    … = read(fd, buf, BUFSIZE*sizeof(char));

    char buf;

    … = read(fd, &buf, sizeof(char)); //NOT buf sizeof(char) 항상 1바이트 줌. sizeof(buf) 써도 될듯?
```
## **7. Data Types and Machine-Level Representation**
- Primitive types: 
    - char, short, int, long, long long, float, double, long double.

- Sizes and alignments vary by architecture:
    - sizeof(int) is usually 4 bytes.
    - sizeof(long) is 4 or 8 depending on 32/64-bit system.

- void* used for generic pointer types in memory operations.

## **8. Data Alignment**
- Data must be stored at addresses aligned to their size:
    - 4-byte integers → address divisible by 4.

- Misaligned access may be penalized or even cause faults (architecture-dependent).
- Padding bytes inserted to satisfy alignment constraints.
- Examples:
    - Structs with mixed types require padding to maintain alignment of each field.
    - Aligning long double (16-byte) fields can introduce large gaps.

## **9. Data Alignment in Practice**
- Compiler inserts padding between struct fields to align each according to its requirement.
- Composite structure layout:
  ```c
  struct S {
      char c;
      int i;       
      double d;    
  };
  ```
  
- sizeof(struct S) > sum of individual field sizes due to padding.

- Padding: 구조체의 크기는 가장 큰 멤버의 정렬 요구사항의 배수로 결정됩니다.

char c:
크기: 1바이트
정렬 요구사항: 1바이트
배치 위치: 0번지
다음 멤버(int i)를 4바이트 경계에 맞추기 위해 3바이트 패딩 추가.

int i:
크기: 4바이트
정렬 요구사항: 4바이트
배치 위치: 4번지

double d:
크기: 8바이트
정렬 요구사항: 8바이트
배치 위치: 8번지

## **10. Composite Data Types**
- Arrays: Contiguous elements, fixed size.
    - Address of element i: base + i * sizeof(T).

- Structs: Sequential, heterogeneous types with alignment-aware layout.

- Unions: All members overlap—only one active at a time.
    - Size = max(member sizes); alignment = max(alignment requirement).

## **11. Function Parameter Passing**
- By value:
    - Copy of argument passed; modifications inside the callee don’t affect the caller.
    - Used for simple types (int, float).

- By reference:
    - Address passed instead; modifications visible to the caller. Which affects original value.
    - Necessary for arrays, structs, large data objects.
    - Implemented using pointers.

## **12. Assembly-Level View of Passing by Reference**
- Function arguments passed in registers or on stack depending on ABI.
- int foo(int *a):
    - Loads value at *a into register.
    - Performs arithmetic.
    - Stores result back to *a.

## **13. Command-Line Arguments**
- Passed to main() as argc and argv.
    - argc: argument count.
    - argv: array of C-style strings.

- argv[0] is the program name.
- Useful for scripting, automation, and dynamic configuration.

## **14. Practical Debugging and Memory Introspection**
- Printing addresses shows memory layout:
    - Can reveal stack vs. heap vs. static/global sections.

- Useful for understanding stack growth, parameter passing, pointer relationships.

## **15. Summary**
- Variable = label for memory region.
- Pointers = variables holding memory addresses.
- Data alignment is crucial for performance and correctness.
- Structs and arrays follow deterministic memory layout rules.
- Parameter passing affects whether function changes affect the caller.
- C allows direct, low-level memory access—powerful but dangerous if misused.
- Compiler and architecture jointly determine memory layout, alignment, and behavior.
