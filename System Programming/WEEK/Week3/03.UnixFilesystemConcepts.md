# **03. Unix Filesystem Concepts Lecture Summary**

## **1. The Unix File Concept**

- **Everything is a File**
  - In Unix systems, everything is represented as a file.
  - Includes regular files, directories, network sockets, virtual filesystems (/proc), device files, etc.

- **Structure of Unix Files**
  - Files are treated as simple byte sequences.
  - The OS does not interpret file formats, only providing a byte stream. To the kernel, there is no difference between a text file and a binary file. They are both just a simple sequence of bytes.
  - Example: A file containing characters 'a-z'.

- **Special File Types**
  - **Directory Files**: Files consisted of an array of links, where each link mapped a filename to a file, which could be another directory. (Contain file names and inode numbers).
  - **Device Files**: Categorized into character and block devices.
    - Character special files: Handle data sequentially, don't need random access (e.g., keyboards, mice, terminals).
    - Block special files: Handle fixed-size blocks, allow random access (e.g., HDD, SSD, CD/DVD).
  - **FIFO (Named Pipe) & Sockets**: Used for inter-process communication. The difference between the socket and the named pipe is that the socket supports bidirectional communication.

## **2. Unix I/O System**

- **Unified I/O Handling**
  - All devices are represented as files, allowing a consistent I/O interface.
  - An application announces its intention to access an I/O device by asking the kernel to `open()` the corresponding file.
  - System calls like `read()` and `write()` interact uniformly with files and devices.
  - `read()` system call copies at most n bytes from the current file position of descriptor fd to memory location buf.
  - `write()` system call copies at most n bytes from memory location buf to the current file position of descriptor fd.

- **Extended File Interface**
  - Memory-mapped files using `mmap()`.
  - Virtual filesystems like `/proc` and `/sys` for accessing OS data.

## **3. The Unix Filesystem Structure**

- **Root Directory Structure**
  - `/`: Single root filesystem.
  - Unlike Windows, no concept of drives; all filesystems are integrated into a single tree.
  - External filesystems can be mounted at specific mount points.

- **Filesystem Mount Options**
  - `ro`: Read-only.
  - `noatime`: Prevents access time updates.
  - `noexec`: Disallows program execution.
  - `nosuid`: Disables SUID/SGID bits.

## **4. File Ownership & Permissions**

- **File Ownership**
  - Each file is owned by a user and a group.
  - Use `ls -l` to check ownership and permissions.

- **Unix File Permissions**
  - `rwx` (read, write, execute) permissions are assigned to user, group, and others.
  - Modify with `chmod`, `chown`.
  - Example:
    ```sh
    chmod 750 script.sh   # Owner: rwx, Group: r-x, Others: ---
    ```

- **Symbolic vs Hard Links**
  - Hard links: Share the same inode (file persists until all links are removed).
  - Symbolic links: Reference the original file path (breaks if the original file is deleted).

## **5. Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**

- **Standard Filesystem Layout**
  - Maintained by the Linux Foundation.
  - Key directories:
    - `/bin`, `/sbin`: Essential executables.
    - `/etc`: System configuration files.
    - `/home`: User home directories.
    - `/var`: Logs, caches, and variable data.
    - `/tmp`: Temporary file storage.

## **6. Unix Filesystem Security**

- **Basic Security Model**
  - `SUID/SGID`: Allows execution with the owner's permissions.
  - `Sticky Bit`: Restricts file renaming or deleting of files in shared directories by the owner of the file(e.g., `/tmp`).
  - `ACL (Access Control List)`: Extends `rwx` model for detailed access control.

- **Security Risks & Mitigation**
  - `SUID/SGID` files can be exploited for privilege escalation → Disable if unnecessary.
  - Executable world-writable directories (`/tmp`) pose security risks → Use `noexec` mount option.
  - Check filesystem flags using `fstatfs()` (`ST_NOEXEC`, `ST_NOSUID`).

## **7. Extended File Attributes**

- **Extended File Attributes (xattr)**
  - Store metadata as key-value pairs.
  - Namespaces:
    - `user`: Stores additional user-defined metadata.
    - `system`: Kernel-managed attributes.
    - `trusted`: Visible only to processes with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.
    - `security`: Used by SELinux and other security modules.
  - Example:
    ```sh
    setfattr -n user.comment -v "This is a test file" file.txt
    getfattr -n user.comment file.txt
    ```
    
## **8. Summary**

- Unix represents everything as a file and uses a single-root filesystem structure.
- Files and directories are managed through links and permissions.
- Security features include `SUID`, `SGID`, `ACL`, and `xattr`.
- FHS defines a standard directory structure to organize system and user data.
