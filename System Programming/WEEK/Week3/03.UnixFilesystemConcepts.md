# **03. Unix Filesystem Concepts Lecture Summary**

## **1. The Unix File Concept**

- **Everything is a File**
  - In Unix systems, everything is represented as a file.
  - Includes regular files, directories, network sockets, virtual filesystems (/proc), device files, etc.

- **Structure of Unix Files**
  - Files are treated as simple byte sequences.
  - The OS does not interpret file formats, only providing a byte stream. To the kernel, there is no difference between a text file and a binary file. They are both just a simple sequence of bytes.
  - Example: A file containing characters 'a-z'.

- **Special File Types**
  - **Directory Files**: Files consisted of an array of links, where each link mapped a filename to a file, which could be another directory. (Contain file names and inode numbers).
  - **Device Files**: Categorized into character and block devices.
    - Character special files: Handle data sequentially, don't need random access (e.g., keyboards, mice, terminals).
    - Block special files: Handle fixed-size blocks, allow random access (e.g., HDD, SSD, CD/DVD).
  - **FIFO (Named Pipe) & Sockets**: Used for inter-process communication. The difference between the socket and the named pipe is that the socket supports bidirectional communication.
  Data written to a FIFO file by one process can be read by another in the same order 
  mkfifo abc; 
  gzip –c < abc > abc.gz&; 
  cat document.txt > abc; 
  rm abc

## **2. Unix I/O System**

- **Unified I/O Handling**
  - All devices are represented as files, allowing a consistent I/O interface.
  - An application announces its intention to access an I/O device by asking the kernel to `open()` the corresponding file.
  - System calls like `read()` and `write()` interact uniformly with files and devices.
  - `read()` system call copies at most n bytes from **the current file position of descriptor fd** to **memory location buf**.
  - `write()` system call copies at most n bytes from memory location buf to the current file position of descriptor fd.

- **Extended File Interface**
  - Memory-mapped files using `mmap()`.
  - Virtual filesystems like `/proc` and `/sys` for accessing OS data.

## **3. The Unix Filesystem Structure**

- **Root Directory Structure**
  - `/`: Single root filesystem.
  - Unlike Windows, no concept of drives; all filesystems are integrated into a single tree.
  - External filesystems can be mounted at specific mount points.

- **Filesystem Mount Options**
  - `ro`: Read-only.
  - `noatime`: Prevents access time updates.
  - `noexec`: Disallows program execution.
  - `nosuid`: Disables SUID/SGID bits.

## **4. File Ownership & Permissions**

- **File Ownership**
  - Each file is owned by a user and a group.
  - Use `ls -l` to check ownership and permissions.

- **Unix File Permissions**
  - `rwx` (read, write, execute) permissions are assigned to user, group, and others.
  - Modify with `chmod`, `chown`.
  - Example:
    ```sh
    chmod 750 script.sh   # Owner: rwx, Group: r-x, Others: ---
    ```

- **Symbolic vs Hard Links**
  - Hard links: Share the same inode (file persists until all links are removed).
  ln: create hard link
  - Symbolic links: Reference the original file path (breaks if the original file is deleted).
  ln -s: create soft (symbolic) link

Example:
  ```m
  $ printf "hello" > hello.txt
  $ printf "test" > test.txt
  $ ls -l
  total 8
  -rw-r--r-- 1 devel users 5 Sep 27 01:10 hello.txt
  -rw-r--r-- 1 devel users 4 Sep 27 01:11 test.txt
  
  $ ln hello.txt helloworld.txt // hard link helloworld.txt with hello.txt
  $ ln -s test.txt testing  // soft link testing with test.txt
  $ ls -l
  total 12
  -rw-r--r-- 2 devel users 5 Sep 27 01:10 hello.txt // 2 : hard link counts, 5: 파일 크기
  -rw-r--r-- 2 devel users 5 Sep 27 01:10 helloworld.txt
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 devel users 8 Sep 27 01:12 testing -> test.txt //l: soft (symbolic) link flag
  -rw-r--r-- 1 devel users 4 Sep 27 01:11 test.txt

  $ printf ", world!"\\n >> helloworld.txt
  $ printf ", test, and test!"\\n >> testing 
  
  $ cat test.txt
  test, test, and test!
  
  $ cat testing // 소프트 링킹되도 출력은 같음.
  test, test, and test!
  
  $ ls -l
  total 12
  -rw-r--r-- 2 devel users 14 Sep 27 01:12 hello.txt // 파일 크기: 5 > 14 하드링킹된 것도 같이 수정됨.
  -rw-r--r-- 2 devel users 14 Sep 27 01:12 helloworld.txt
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 devel users  8 Sep 27 01:12 testing -> test.txt 
  -rw-r--r-- 1 devel users 22 Sep 27 01:13 test.txt // 파일 크기: 4 > 22 소프트링킹된 경우 파일자체는 원본만 수정됨.
  
  $ rm hello.txt
  $ rm test.txt
  
  $ ls -l
  total 4
  -rw-r--r-- 1 devel users 14 Sep 27 01:12 helloworld.txt
  lrwxrwxrwx 1 devel users  8 Sep 27 01:12 testing -> test.txt //broken soft link.
  
  $ cat helloworld.txt
  hello, world!
  
  $ cat testing
  cat: testing: No such file or directory 
  ```

## **5. Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)**
- **Special (hidden) entries**
  - “.”	current directory
  - “..”	parent directory (hence “cd ..”)
  - Each directory has '.’ that points to itself

  If a directory has N subdirectories
  - Each subdirectory has ‘..’ that points to the parent directory
  - number of hard links of 'sample’: 1 (itself) + 1(‘.’) + 2 (‘..’ inside dir1 and dir2) =  4
  
- **Standard Filesystem Layout**
  - The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
  - Maintained by the Linux Foundation.
  - Key directories:
    - `/bin`, `/sbin`: Essential executables.
    - `/etc`: System configuration files.
    - `/home`: User home directories.
    - `/var`: Logs, caches, and variable data.
    - `/tmp`: Temporary file storage.

## **6. Unix Filesystem Security**
- Modify with `chmod`.
  - Example:
    ```sh
    chmod 750 script.sh   # Owner: rwx, Group: r-x, Others: ---
    ```

- **Basic Security Model**
  - `SUID/SGID`: Allows execution with the owner's permissions.
    - devel@csapvm $ ls -l /usr/bin/sudo
      -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 204320 Sep  1 16:17 /usr/bin/sudo 
    **s**가 의미하는 게 SUID/SGID
    flag available in struct  stat (S_ISUID / S_ISGID): man 2 stat, man 7 inode

  - Set user/group owner
    sudo chown <usr>[:<grp>]
  - Set suid/sgid bit
    - suid bit
      sudo chmod 4755 <exe>
    - sgid bit
      sudo chmod 2755 <exe>
    - suid+sgid bits
      sudo chmod 6755 <exe>

  Example:
  ```sh
    devel@csapvm ~/work/03 $ gcc -o wai whoami.c 
    devel@csapvm ~/work/03 $ ./wai 
    User & group information
    ------------------------
      User:             devel            (1000)
      Group:            devel            (1000)
    
      Effective user:   devel            (1000)
      Effective group:  devel            (1000)
    
    devel@csapvm ~/work/03 $ sudo chown tester:users wai
    devel@csapvm ~/work/03 $ sudo chmod 4755 wai
    devel@csapvm ~/work/03 $ ls -l
    total 20
    -rwsr-xr-x 1 tester users 16000 Sep 27 02:32 wai
    -rw-r--r-- 1 devel  devel  1380 Sep 27 02:31 whoami.c
    
    devel@csapvm ~/work/03 $ ./wai 
    User & group information
    ------------------------
      User:             devel            (1000)
      Group:            devel            (1000)
    
      Effective user:   tester           (1001)
      Effective group:  devel            (1000)
  ```
    
  - `Sticky Bit`: Restricts file renaming or deleting of files in shared directories by the owner of the file(e.g., `/tmp`).
    - devel@csapvm $ ls -ld /tmp
      drwxrwxrwt 6 root root 240 Oct  8 14:32 /tmp
    **t**가 의미하는게 Sticky bit
    flag available in struct stat (S_ISVTX): man 2 stat, man 7 inode
    - devel@csapvm $ ls -ld /tmp
      drwxrwxrwx 6 root root 240 Oct  8 14:32 /tmp
      or
      drwxrwxrwt 6 root root 240 Oct  8 14:32 /tmp
    이때 접근 가능한건지 아닌지 확인하기 위해서 flag check.
    S_IWOTH : world-writable flag
    ST_NOEXEC : disallow execution flag

  - `ACL (Access Control List)`: Extends `rwx` model for detailed access control.
  for user, group, and other (=everybody else)
  read, write, and execute permission
  many “dangerous” configurations possible, especially sticky, suid/sgid bits
  Extended file attributes (xattrs) provide finer-grained control

- **Security Risks & Mitigation**
  - `SUID/SGID` files can be exploited for privilege escalation → Disable if unnecessary.
  - Executable world-writable directories (`/tmp`) pose security risks → Use `noexec` mount option.
  - Check filesystem flags using `fstatfs()` (`ST_NOEXEC`, `ST_NOSUID`).

## **7. Extended File Attributes**

- **Extended File Attributes (xattr)**
  - Store metadata as key-value pairs.
  - Namespaces:
    - `user`: Stores additional user-defined metadata.
    - `system`: Kernel-managed attributes.
    - `trusted`: Visible only to processes with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.
    - `security`: Used by SELinux and other security modules.
  - Example:
    ```sh
    setfattr -n user.comment -v "This is a test file" file.txt
    getfattr -n user.comment file.txt
    ```
    
## **8. Summary**

- Unix represents everything as a file and uses a single-root filesystem structure.
- Files and directories are managed through links and permissions.
- Security features include `SUID`, `SGID`, `ACL`, and `xattr`.
- FHS defines a standard directory structure to organize system and user data.
