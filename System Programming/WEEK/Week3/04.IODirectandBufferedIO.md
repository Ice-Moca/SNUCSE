## **1. Introduction to Unix I/O**
- Unix I/O is the **lowest level** of input/output operations available to an application programmer.
- It is implemented with **system calls** that provide a standardized interface for accessing various file types:
  - **Regular files**
  - **Directories**
  - **Block devices (disks, partitions, etc.)**
  - **Character devices (keyboards, mice, etc.)**
  - **Pipes and sockets**
- The Unix I/O system follows the **"everything is a file"** abstraction, ensuring uniform handling of different input and output sources.

---

## **2. File Descriptors in Unix I/O**
- **File Descriptor (fd)**: A non-negative integer that uniquely identifies an open file within a process.
- Each process starts with **three default file descriptors**:
  - `0`: **Standard Input (STDIN_FILENO)**
  - `1`: **Standard Output (STDOUT_FILENO)**
  - `2`: **Standard Error (STDERR_FILENO)**
- Other file descriptors are assigned when a file is opened.
    ```c
    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    int fd = open("unix.io", O_CREAT | O_WRONLY, S_IRWXU | S_IRGRP); // |: bit-or 연산
    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("Cannot open file");
        return -1;
    }
    ```

## **3. Opening, Creating, and Closing Files**
### **3.1 Opening Files (open)**
- Syntax:
    ```c
    int open(const char *pathname, int flags);
    int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);
    ```
- Flags:
    - O_RDONLY (Read-only)
    - O_WRONLY (Write-only)
    - O_RDWR (Read & Write)
    - O_CREAT (Create file if it does not exist)
    - O_APPEND (Append mode)
    - O_TRUNC (Truncate file)
- Modes:
    - S_IRWXU (Grant read, write, and execute permissions to the user)
    - S_IRWXG (Grant read, write, and execute permissions to the group)
    - S_IRWXO (Grant read, write, and execute permissions to the others)
    - and so on.

### **3.2 Creating Files (creat)**
- Syntax:
    ```c
    int creat(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);
    ```
- Modes:
    - S_IRWXU (Grant read, write, and execute permissions to the user)
    - S_IRWXG (Grant read, write, and execute permissions to the group)
    - S_IRWXO (Grant read, write, and execute permissions to the others)
    - and so on.
- Equivalent to open(pathname, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, mode)

### **3.3 Closing Files (close)**
- Syntax:
    ```c
    int close(int fd); // Returns 0 on success, -1 on error
    ```
- Issues with closing files:
    - Closing an already closed file is an error.
    - File descriptors can be reassigned to new files, leading to unexpected behavior in multi-threaded environments.

    ```c
    int retval = close(fd);
    if (retval < 0) {
        perror("Cannot close file");
    }
    ```

## *4. Reading and Writing Files**
Reading/writing a file copies count bytes from the current file position to memory or vice-versa, and then updates the file position
Return value of < 0 indicates that an error occurred (see manpage)
Short counts, i.e., retval < sizeof(buf), are possible and not necessarily errors (more details later)

### **4.1 Reading Files (read)**
- Syntax:
    ```c
    ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
    ```
- Reads up to count bytes from fd into buf, updating the file position.
    ```c
    char buf[512];
    ssize_t nbytes = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
    if (nbytes < 0) {
        perror("Cannot read from file");
    }
    ```

### **4.2 Writing Files (write)**
- Syntax:
    ```c
    ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
    ```
- Writes count bytes from buf to fd, updating the file position.
    ```c
    char buf[512];
    ssize_t nbytes = write(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
    if (nbytes < 0) {
        perror("Cannot write from file");
    }
    ```
- write() requires us to specify the number of bytes to write
    use ‘strlen()’ from the string API (string.h) is correct here because the string ‘str’ includes a terminating \0 character at its end which is included in sizeof(str) but ignored by ‘strlen(str)’
    ```c
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <string.h>
    char str[] = "Hello, world\n";
    
    int main(void)
    {
      write(STDOUT_FILENO, str, strlen(str));
      return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }
    ```

### **4.3 Short Counts**
- Short counts can occur in many situations:
    - Encountering EOF (end-of-file) on reads
    - Filesystem full on write
    - Reading text lines from a terminal
    - Reading and writing network sockets or Unix pipes
    - Interrupts and signals sent to the process
- A short count is a situation when Unix I/O reads/writes fewer bytes than requested, but does not report an error (-1).
    Example:
    ```c
    ssize_t nbytes = read(fd, buf, 512);
    printf("Read %ld bytes.\n", nbytes);
    Read 302 bytes
    ```
- Dealing with short counts requires careful inspection of the return value and errno
- Copying Data
“unixio” appends n bytes from offset ofs in file input to file output
```sh
    $ ./unixio data.dat test.dat 400000 100000
    Opening input file 'data.dat'...
    Opening output file 'test.dat'...
    Seeking input file to position 400000...
    Copying 100000 bytes...
      Short count of 27776 when trying to read 34464 bytes from input
      copied a total of 93312 bytes.
    Closing files...
 ```

## **5. Seeking in Files (lseek)**

- Purpose: Modify the file position within an open file.
- Syntax:
    ```c
    off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);
    ```
- Whence:
    - SEEK_SET (Set file position to offset) filepos = offset
    - SEEK_CUR (Move file position by offset from the current position) filepos = filepos + offset
    - SEEK_END (Move file position by offset from the end of the file) filepos = end + offset (can seek beyond end of file)
- Use Case: Change the file position
    ```c
    if (lseek(fd, 100, SEEK_SET) < 0) {
        perror("Cannot seek in file");
    }
    ```

## **6. Standard I/O (Buffered I/O)**
### **6.1 Introduction**
- Unix I/O is low-level and unbuffered, meaning each call interacts directly with the kernel.
- Standard I/O provides buffering (improving efficiency) & formatted I/O.
- Implemented in the C standard library (stdio.h).
    ```c
    FILE *f = fopen("standard.io", "r+");
    ```

### **6.2 Standard I/O Streams**
- The C standard library provides three default streams:
    - stdin (standard input)
    - stdout (standard output)
    - stderr (standard error)
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    extern FILE *stdin;
    extern FILE *stdout;
    extern FILE *stderr;
    ```

### **6.3 Standard I/O API**
Achieving the second goal: provide a formatted I/O library (fprintf/fscanf family)
stdio.h

- fopen / fclose → Open/close files
- fread / fwrite → Read/write data
- fscanf / fprintf → Formatted I/O
- fseek → Seek in files
    ```c
    FILE *fp = fopen("file.txt", "r");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        perror("Cannot open file");
    }
    ```

## **7. Buffering in Standard I/O**

Achieving the first goal: use a buffer to reduce number of read() and write() system calls
Standard I/O: buffered read
Use Unix read to grab block of bytes
User input functions take one byte at a time from buffer
Refill buffer when empty

### **7.1 Types of Buffering**
- Fully buffered (_IOFBF): Buffer is written when full (default for files).
- Line buffered (_IOLBF): Buffer is written when newline \n is encountered (default for terminal output).
- Unbuffered (_IONBF): Every operation directly interacts with the OS (default for stderr).
    ```c
    setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IOLBF, 0);
    ```
### **7.2 Flushing Buffers (fflush)**
- Forces immediate writing of buffered data.
  Buffer flushed to output fd on "\n" or fflush() call
    ```c
    fflush(stdout);
    ```
## **8. Summary**
### 8.1 **Unix I/O Summary**
- ✅ Pros:
    - Lowest overhead, highest control
    - Async-signal-safe (can be used in signal handlers)
    - Provides file metadata access (stat, fstat)
- ❌ Cons:
    - Dealing with short reads/writes is complex
    - No built-in buffering (every call interacts with the kernel)

### **8.2 Standard I/O Summary**
- ✅ Pros:
    - Buffered → reduces system calls and improves efficiency
    - Provides formatted I/O (fprintf, fscanf)
    - Short reads/writes handled automatically
- ❌ Cons:
    - Not async-signal-safe (not suitable for signal handlers)
    - Not suitable for network sockets (due to internal buffering issues)

### **8.3 General Guidelines**
- Use Standard I/O for disk and terminal I/O.
- Use Unix I/O for signal handlers and low-level file operations.
- Avoid Standard I/O for network sockets (use custom I/O handling instead).
