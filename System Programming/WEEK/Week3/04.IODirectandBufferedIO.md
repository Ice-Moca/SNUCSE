# **04.Direct and Buffered IO Lecture Summary**

## **1. Introduction to Unix I/O**
- Unix I/O is the **lowest level** of input/output operations available to an application programmer.
- It is implemented with **system calls** that provide a standardized interface for accessing various file types:
  - **Regular files**
  - **Directories**
  - **Block devices (disks, partitions, etc.)**
  - **Character devices (keyboards, mice, etc.)**
  - **Pipes and sockets**
- The Unix I/O system follows the **"everything is a file"** abstraction, ensuring uniform handling of different input and output sources.

## **2. File Descriptors in Unix I/O**
- **File Descriptor (fd)**: A non-negative integer that uniquely identifies an open file within a process.
- Each process starts with **three default file descriptors**:
  - `0`: **Standard Input (STDIN_FILENO)**
  - `1`: **Standard Output (STDOUT_FILENO)**
  - `2`: **Standard Error (STDERR_FILENO)**
- Other file descriptors are assigned when a file is opened.
    ```c
    #include <fcntl.h>
    #include <unistd.h>

    int fd = open("unix.io", O_CREAT | O_WRONLY, S_IRWXU | S_IRGRP);
    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("Cannot open file");
        return -1;
    }
    ```

## **3. Opening, Creating, and Closing Files**
### **3.1 Opening Files (open)**
- Syntax:
    ```c
    int open(const char *pathname, int flags);
    int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode);
    ```
- Flags:
    - O_RDONLY (Read-only)
    - O_WRONLY (Write-only)
    - O_RDWR (Read & Write)
    - O_CREAT (Create file if it does not exist)
    - O_APPEND (Append mode)
    - O_TRUNC (Truncate file)
- Modes:
    - S_IRWXU (Grant read, write, and execute permissions to the user)
    - S_IRWXG (Grant read, write, and execute permissions to the group)
    - S_IRWXO (Grant read, write, and execute permissions to the others)
    - and so on.

### **3.2 Creating Files (creat)**
- Syntax:
    ```c
    int creat(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);
    ```
- Modes:
    - S_IRWXU (Grant read, write, and execute permissions to the user)
    - S_IRWXG (Grant read, write, and execute permissions to the group)
    - S_IRWXO (Grant read, write, and execute permissions to the others)
    - and so on.
- Equivalent to open(pathname, O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, mode)

### **3.3 Closing Files (close)**
- Syntax:
    ```c
    int close(int fd);
    ```
- Issues with closing files:
    - Closing an already closed file is an error.
    - File descriptors can be reassigned to new files, leading to unexpected behavior in multi-threaded environments.

    ```c
    int retval = close(fd);
    if (retval < 0) {
        perror("Cannot close file");
    }
    ```

## *4. Reading and Writing Files**
### **4.1 Reading Files (read)**
- Syntax:
    ```c
    ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
    ```
- Reads up to count bytes from fd into buf, updating the file position.

### **4.2 Writing Files (write)**
- Syntax:
    ```c
    ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
    ```
- Writes count bytes from buf to fd, updating the file position.
    ```c
    char buf[512];
    ssize_t nbytes = read(fd, buf, sizeof(buf));
    if (nbytes < 0) {
        perror("Cannot read from file");
    }
    ```

### **4.3 Short Counts**
- Short counts can occur in many situations:
    - Encountering EOF (end-of-file) on reads
    - Filesystem full on write
    - Reading text lines from a terminal
    - Reading and writing network sockets or Unix pipes
    - Interrupts and signals sent to the process

## **5. Seeking in Files (lseek)**

- Purpose: Modify the file position within an open file.
- Syntax:
    ```c
    off_t lseek(int fd, off_t offset, int whence);
    ```
- Whence:
    - SEEK_SET (Set file position to offset)
    - SEEK_CUR (Move file position by offset from the current position)
    - SEEK_END (Move file position by offset from the end of the file)
- Use Case: Change the file position
    ```c
    if (lseek(fd, 100, SEEK_SET) < 0) {
        perror("Cannot seek in file");
    }
    ```

## **6. Standard I/O (Buffered I/O)**
### **6.1 Introduction**
- Unix I/O is low-level and unbuffered, meaning each call interacts directly with the kernel.
- Standard I/O provides buffering (improving efficiency) & formatted I/O.
- Implemented in the C standard library (stdio.h).
    ```c
    FILE *f = fopen("standard.io", "r+");
    ```

### **6.2 Standard I/O Streams**
- The C standard library provides three default streams:
    - stdin (standard input)
    - stdout (standard output)
    - stderr (standard error)
    ```c
    #include <stdio.h>

    extern FILE *stdin;
    extern FILE *stdout;
    extern FILE *stderr;
    ```

### **6.3 Standard I/O API**
- fopen / fclose → Open/close files
- fread / fwrite → Read/write data
- fscanf / fprintf → Formatted I/O
- fseek → Seek in files
    ```c
    FILE *fp = fopen("file.txt", "r");
    if (fp == NULL) {
        perror("Cannot open file");
    }
    ```

## **7. Buffering in Standard I/O**
### **7.1 Types of Buffering**
- Fully buffered (_IOFBF): Buffer is written when full (default for files).
- Line buffered (_IOLBF): Buffer is written when newline \n is encountered (default for terminal output).
- Unbuffered (_IONBF): Every operation directly interacts with the OS (default for stderr).
    ```c
    setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IOLBF, 0);
    ```
### **7.2 Flushing Buffers (fflush)**
- Forces immediate writing of buffered data.
    ```c
    fflush(stdout);
    ```
## **8. Summary**
### 8.1 **Unix I/O Summary**
- ✅ Pros:
    - Lowest overhead, highest control
    - Async-signal-safe (can be used in signal handlers)
    - Provides file metadata access (stat, fstat)
- ❌ Cons:
    - Dealing with short reads/writes is complex
    - No built-in buffering (every call interacts with the kernel)

### **8.2 Standard I/O Summary**
- ✅ Pros:
    - Buffered → reduces system calls and improves efficiency
    - Provides formatted I/O (fprintf, fscanf)
    - Short reads/writes handled automatically
- ❌ Cons:
    - Not async-signal-safe (not suitable for signal handlers)
    - Not suitable for network sockets (due to internal buffering issues)

### **8.3 General Guidelines**
- Use Standard I/O for disk and terminal I/O.
- Use Unix I/O for signal handlers and low-level file operations.
- Avoid Standard I/O for network sockets (use custom I/O handling instead).
