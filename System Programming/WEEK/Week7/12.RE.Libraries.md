# **12. Runtime Environment: Libraries Lecture Summary**

## **1. Static Libraries**

- **Definition**:
  - Archive files (`.a`) containing multiple relocatable `.o` object files.
  - Includes an index for quick symbol lookup.

- **Tool**: `ar` (archiver)
  - Example: `ar rs libc.a atoi.o printf.o random.o`

- **Advantages**:
  - Easy to distribute and reuse across programs.
  - Archiver allows incremental updates.
  - Linker only pulls in required `.o` files from archive.

- **Examples**
    - libc.a (the C standard library): `ar -t /usr/lib/libc.a`
    - libm.a (the C math library): `ar -t /usr/lib/libm.a`

## **2. Problem using Static libraries**
- Command line order matters (refer to the linker's algorithm)
- Duplication in the stored executables
- Duplication in the running executables
- Minor bug fixes of system libraries require each application to explicitly relink

- **Linker's algorithm** for resolving external references
    - Scan .o files and .a files in the command line order.
    - During the scan, keep a list of the current unresolved references.
    - As each new .o or .a file is encountered, try to resolve each unresolved reference in the list against the symbols defined in object files. 
    - If any entries in the unresolved list at end of scan, then error.
    
## **3. ELF Object File Structure (for Loading)**

- **Segments**:
  - `.text`, `.data`, `.bss`, `.rodata`, etc.
  - Loadable segments become part of the memory image.

- **Memory Mapping**:
  - Kernel memory layout includes executable, heap, stack, shared library regions.
  - Dynamically loaded libraries are memory-mapped at runtime.

## 4. Shared (Dynamic) Libraries

- **Definition**:
  - Object files that contain code and data that are loaded and linked into an application dynamically, at either load-time or run-time.
  - `.so` files containing shared code and data, loaded dynamically.
  
- **Advantages**:
  - Code sharing between processes → less memory.
  - Easier library updates without recompilation.
  - Smaller executable size.

- **Dynamic Linking**:
  - **Load-time linking**:
    - Handled by `ld-linux.so` (dynamic linker).
    - Example: linking to `libc.so` or custom `libvector.so`
  - **Run-time linking**:
    - Done via `dlopen()` / `dlsym()`.
    - Enables plugin architectures and hot patching.

## **5. Dynamic Linking Process**

- **Link Time**:
  - Program is partially linked and records the need for shared libraries.

- **Load Time**:
  - Loader (`execve`) invokes dynamic linker to:
    - Map shared libraries into memory.
    - Resolve symbols using `.symtab`, `.got`, `.plt`.

- **Run-Time (Manual)**:
  - Use `dlopen()` to load `.so` manually.
  - Use `dlsym()` to resolve function addresses.

```c
void *handle = dlopen("./libvector.so", RTLD_LAZY);
void (*addvec)(int*, int*, int*, int*) = dlsym(handle, "addvec");
```

- **Use Cases**:
  - Plugin systems, platform-dependent code, memory-constrained systems, dynamic updates.

## **6. Position-Independent Code (PIC)**

- **Concept**:
  - Uses *relative offsets* (e.g., `%rip`-relative in x86_64) rather than absolute addresses.

- **Why?**:
  - Allows shared libraries to be loaded at arbitrary memory locations.
  - Required for:
    - Shared libraries
    - Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
    - Runtime linking

- **Key Structures**:
  - **Global Offset Table (GOT)**:
    - Resides in `.data`, holds addresses used by code.
  - **Program Linkage Table (PLT)**:
    - Used to jump to external functions via GOT.

- **Lazy Linking**:
  - Function pointers in PLT resolved at *first call* via GOT and dynamic linker.

## **7. Library Interpositioning**

### What is it?

- A technique to *intercept and override* function calls to existing libraries without modifying the source code.
- Allows observing or altering behavior of standard functions like `malloc`, `free`.

### Types of Interpositioning

1. **Compile-Time**:
   - Macro-expansion of function calls (e.g., `malloc()` → `mymalloc()`).
   - Requires source code.
   - Example via `malloc.h`:
     ```c
     #define malloc(size) mymalloc(size, __FILE__, __LINE__)
     ```

2. **Link-Time**:
   - Use linker flags: `-Wl,--wrap,malloc`
   - Rename references:
     - `malloc` → `__wrap_malloc`
     - `__real_malloc` → real `malloc`
   - Requires relocatable object file

3. **Load-Time (Runtime)**:
   - Use `LD_PRELOAD` to inject shared library at runtime.
   - Does not require source or relinking.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     LD_PRELOAD=./mymalloc.so ./myapp
     ```

## **8. Practical Applications of Interpositioning**
- **Security**:
  - Sandbox processes by overriding dangerous system calls.

- **Monitoring**:
  - Record calls to functions for profiling, debugging.

- **Hot Patching**:
  - Override buggy library functions without restarting applications.

- **Address Trace Generation**:
  - Useful in memory profiling, leak detection.

## **9. Summary**
- **Understanding the role of static and dynamic libraries is essential** for building efficient, modular, and updatable software systems.
- **Library interpositioning** is a powerful, sometimes underestimated, technique useful in research, debugging, and security engineering.
- The concepts of **PIC**, **GOT/PLT**, and **runtime dynamic linking** form the backbone of modern executable environments in Linux.
