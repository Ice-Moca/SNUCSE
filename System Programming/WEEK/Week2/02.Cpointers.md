# **02. C Pointers Lecture Summary**

## **1. Lecture Objectives**
- Learn pointer concepts: memory and addresses, pointer variables, pointer operators, and their relationship with arrays.
- Pointers are difficult to master and can be dangerous but are efficient and convenient.
- Practice is essential to internalize pointer usage.

## **2. Variables and Memory Addresses**
- Every variable resides in a specific memory address.
- A variable consists of a **name, value, and address**.
- A pointer variable **stores an address**.
- In 64-bit systems, pointer variable size is 8 bytes, as they need to store memory addresses.
- `int *p;` declares a pointer variable 'p' that stores the address of an integer variable. Here, 'int' indicates the type of data the pointer points to, and does not determine the size of the pointer variable 'p' itself."

## **3. Pointer Declaration and Operators**
- `&` (Address Operator): Returns the address of a variable.
- `*` (Dereference Operator): Accesses the value stored at the pointer's address.
- Example:
  ```c
  int i = 10;
  int *p = &i;
  printf("%d", *p); // Prints 10
  ```

## **4. Pointer Assignment and Risks**
- Pointers must be initialized (`NULL` is recommended if not assigned).
- Dereferencing an uninitialized pointer leads to **invalid memory access errors**.
- Incorrect example:
  ```c
  int *p;
  printf("%d", *p); // Error
  ```

## **5. Pointer Arithmetic**
- `p + n`: Moves the pointer by `n` elements (useful with arrays).
- Subtracting pointers: Calculates the distance between elements in an array.
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) are valid only within the same array.

## **6. Using Pointers in Functions**
- Passing pointers as function arguments enables **Call by Reference**.
- Example:
  ```c
  void changeValue(int *p) {
      *p = 20;
  }
  int i = 10;
  changeValue(&i); // i is now 20
  ```
- Returning a pointer:
  - Do **not** return the address of a local variable (its memory is deallocated after the function exits).

## **7. Array and Pointer Relationship**
- `a[i]` is equivalent to `*(a + i)`.
- `&a[i]` is equivalent to `a + i`.
- The array name itself represents the address of the first element. (= An array's name can be used as a pointer to the array's first element)
- When passing arrays to functions, the array's first element's address is passed, not the entire array.

## **8. Double Pointers (Pointer to Pointer)**
- A pointer that stores the address of another pointer (`int **p`).
- Useful for dynamic memory allocation.
- Example:
  ```c
  int i = 10;
  int *p = &i;
  int **pp = &p;
  printf("%d", **pp); // Prints 10
  ```

## **9. Complex Pointer Declarations**
- `int *p[10];` → Array of 10 integer pointers.
- `int (*p)[10];` → Pointer to an array of 10 integers.
- Example:
  ```c
  int main() {
    int arr[3][10] = {
        {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10},
        {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20},
        {21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30}
    };

    int (*p)[10];

    p = arr;

    printf("%d\n", (*p)[0]); // 1
    printf("%d\n", (*p)[9]); // 10

    p++;

    printf("%d\n", (*p)[0]); // 11
    printf("%d\n", (*p)[9]); // 20

    return 0;
  }
  ```
- `int (*pf)(void);` → Pointer to a function returning an `int`.
- Example:
  ```c
    int func1(void) {
        return 10;  
    }

    int func2(void) {
        return 20;
    }

    int main() {
        int (*pf)(void);

        pf = func1; // func1 
        printf("%d\n", pf()); // 10

        pf = func2; // func2 
        printf("%d\n", pf()); // 20

        return 0;
    }
  ```
## **10. Summary**
- A pointer stores a memory address.
- `&` retrieves an address, while `*` accesses the value stored at the address.
- Arrays and pointers are closely related.
- Misusing pointers can lead to program crashes (initialization is essential).
