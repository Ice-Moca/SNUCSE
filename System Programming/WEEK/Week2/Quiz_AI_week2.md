# 2025 Spring SNU System Programming - Weekly Quiz (Week 2)

We have prepared some light quizzes related to class content of week 2.  
These problems have been selected from those generated by **AI tool (Cramify)**,  
based on your class ppt content.

There is no need to submit anything after reviewing this material,  
but we hope it will help you review the class content you learned this week and prepare for the quiz.

Weekly Quiz has two documents, one with only the problems and  
the other with both the problems and solutions.  

# Question 1

Consider the following C code snippet:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int state = 1;
  char input;

  while ((input = getchar()) != EOF) {
    if (state == 1 && input == 'a') {
      // Perform some action
      state = 2;
    } else if (state == 2 && input == 'b') {
      // Perform another action
      state = 1;
    }
  }
  return 0;
}
```

What is the primary advantage of replacing the magic numbers 1 and 2 with named constants like `STATE_A` and `STATE_B` using `enum` or `#define?`

A) Faster execution speed  
B) Reduced memory consumption  
C) Improved code readability and maintainability  
D) Enhanced type safety  

# Question 2

Outline the four key stages involved in building a C program, briefly describing the purpose and outcome of each stage.  
Specifically, what transformations occur to the source code at each step, and what are the intermediate file types generated?

# Question 3

Given the following C code snippet:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("characters: %c %c %c\n", 'A' + 'a' - 'A', 'c' - ('a' - 'A'), 'D' + 32);
    return 0;
}
```

What will be the output of this program?

# Question 4

In C, if we declare an integer variable 'x' and assign it the value 10, and then declare a pointer variable 'ptr' and assign it the address of 'x', what do 'x', '&x', and 'ptr' each represent?

# Question 5

In the C code snippet below, what are the values of *ptr and &var after the assignment?

```c
int var = 10;
int *ptr;
ptr = &var;
```

A) Both *ptr and &var are the memory address of var.  
B) Both *ptr and &var are 10.  
C) *ptr is 10, and &var is the memory address of var.  
D) *ptr is the memory address of var, and &var is 10.

# Question 6

Given the declaration `int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};`, explain the equivalence between `arr` and `&arr[0]` and the difference between `arr + 1` and `&arr + 1`.  
What values do `*(arr + 2)` and `*(&arr[3])` represent?

# Question 7

Given the C code snippet below, analyze the following statements about pointer arithmetic.  
Assume arr is an integer array of size 10 and ptr is an integer pointer.  
Indicate True or False for each statement.

```c
int arr[10] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};
int *ptr = &arr[0];
```

- a) The expression `ptr + 3` points to the same memory location as `&arr[3]`.

- b) If `ptr` points to `arr[5]`, then `ptr - 2` points to `arr[3]`.

- c) The expression `&arr[7] - &arr[2]` results in the value 5.

- d) If `ptr` points to `arr[0]`, the expression `*ptr + 1` is equivalent to `arr[1]`.

# Question 8

In C, what are the potential dangers of using the indirection operator (*) on a pointer variable that has not been initialized?  
Explain why this is considered unsafe and what consequences might occur.

# Question 9

Which of the following declarations defines a pointer to an array of 10 integer pointers?

A) int *p[10];  
B) int (*p)[10];  
C) int *(*p)[10];  
D) int **p[10];
