# **08.Dynamic Memory Allocation in C (Part I) Lecture Summary**

## **1. Fundamentals of Dynamic Memory Allocation**
- Dynamic memory allocation allows programs to obtain and release memory during runtime, which is essential when the size or number of required data structures is unknown at compile time.
- This mechanism is particularly useful for implementing data structures like dynamic arrays, linked lists, trees, and graphs.
- In C, this flexibility comes with a trade-off: the programmer is fully responsible for managing memory, unlike higher-level languages with built-in garbage collection.
- Without automatic garbage collection, improper management leads to common errors such as memory leaks, dangling pointers, and double frees.
- These are a significant source of bugs in systems programming.

## **2. Core C Library Functions**
- `malloc(size_t size)`: Allocates uninitialized memory of given size.
- `calloc(size_t n, size_t size)`: Allocates zero-initialized memory.
- `realloc(void *ptr, size_t new_size)`: Resizes previously allocated memory.
- `free(void *ptr)`: Frees previously allocated memory.
- Always check for `NULL` after allocation.
- Use of realloc can lead to copying large blocks if memory cannot be expanded in place. Strategies like exponential growth help mitigate this.

## **3. Practical Usage Pattern**
- Allocate → Use → Resize (optional) → Free.
- Always set freed pointers to `NULL`.

## **4. Challenges of Dynamic Allocation**
- Arbitrary size requests and unpredictable order of allocation/free.
- Leads to internal and external fragmentation.
- Fragmentation is mitigated by using techniques like coalescing adjacent blocks and splitting large ones.

## 5. Heap Architecture
- Heap is separate from stack and grows with `brk()` / `sbrk()`.
- Managed by the allocator (typically `libc`).

- **Is a system call**, historically used by `malloc` to request more memory.
- Example:
  ```c
  // Error checking is omitted for better understanding
  void *p = sbrk(0);     // get current break
  sbrk(4096);            // request 4KB more
  ```

## **6. Example Allocation Sequence (Advanced Insight)**
```c
char *p1 = malloc(3);
char *p2 = malloc(1);
char *p3 = malloc(4);
free(p2);
char *p4 = malloc(6);
free(p3);
char *p5 = malloc(2);
free(p1); free(p4); free(p5);
```
- This sequence can cause fragmentation, especially if block sizes differ and are not coalesced properly.
- Fragmentation accumulates over time, and allocators may periodically attempt compaction or aggressive coalescing to address this.

## **7. Fragmentation Types in Depth**
- Internal Fragmentation: Occurs when an allocated block is larger than the payload
- External Fragmentation: Occurs when there is enough aggregate free memory
 to satisfy an allocate request, but no single free block is large enough to handle the request.

## **8. Design Trade-offs and Heuristics**
- First-fit: fast, may waste large chunks.
- Best-fit: less waste, slower.
- Next-fit: compromise between the two.
- Modern allocators often use next-fit with segregated lists or hybrid approaches for better performance in real-world usage.

## **9. alloca() vs malloc(): Stack vs Heap Allocation**

- `alloca(size_t size)` allocates memory on the current function's stack frame.
- Automatically deallocated when the function returns (no need for `free()`).
- **Not a system call** – implemented by compiler with stack pointer adjustment.
- Faster than `malloc`, but:
  - Memory size is limited by the stack.
  - Large allocations may cause stack overflow.
- **Use cases**:
  - Temporary buffers in short-lived functions.
- Warning: Not portable across all systems (some environments don’t support it).

## **10. Summary Recap**
- Dynamic memory allocation is essential but non-trivial in C.
- Manual memory management enables performance, but increases risk.
- Understanding how allocators work allows better use and even custom allocator design.
- Languages with garbage collection automate allocation, but at the cost of performance and control. C trades safety for speed and transparency.
